## Bug Reporting

WSATools is developed just by me. I'd be really thankful if you could report any bugs you hit so I can fix them. Put as many details as you can! If you do, you make it easier (and possibly faster) for me to solve them.
If you wish to report a bug, [open an issue here](https://github.com/Simizfo/WSATools/issues/new)


## Source code availability

I'm someone that enjoys having open source software on his computer, so I understand every single one of you asking for the source code. I've seen a lot of cases of apps stolen from Github and republished on the Microsoft Store without permission, so I'll avoid making it public for now. I'll reconsider this at some point of this software's life.


## What's next for WSATools?

- Stability and bugfixing.
